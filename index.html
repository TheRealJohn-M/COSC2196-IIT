					<h2>About Me:</h2>
					<p>Hello! I'm John Mufunda, a university student at RMIT from Perth,
					WA. I would describe myself as a multifaceted person with many
					interests but also participate in many of them, these interests being
					sports, music, food, computers, gaming and art (photography). I'm
					someone who is open to trying different things and experiencing all
					that the world has to offer, including sharing those experiences with
					family, friends or even people I meet who also engage in the same
					interests. My interesting fact would be that I do photography and it’s
					one of my creative outlets and with the support of friends and family
					I've been able to capture cool moments and express myself creatively
					from personal to semi-professional projects.

                                        <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT extends to both hardware and software, 
					encompassing computers, smartphones or gaming. I find 
					interest in how these technologies change and innovate, but
					how they allow the user to exercise their creativity, 
					individuality or allows them to help others through these 
					different devices. Having additional interest in art and 
					photography I want to explore further how these fields 
					interweave and can enhance each other, as I believe 
					technology allows for art to evolve and expands the ways we
					are able to express ourselves, just as a painter’s creative
					expression is through painting, a programmer’s creative 
					expression is through coding. The fusion of art and 
					technology is something I endeavour to continue to uncover 
					and see how I can impact these two fields for myself, 
					family & friends, community or possibly globally.

                                        <h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
					<p>My interest began at a very young age (~7yo) when my Dad
					got our first home computer or when my brother got his first
					phone, the former a ‘Compaq’ system which ran Windows XP and
					the latter being a ‘Sony Ericsson’ TM series flip phone. At 
					that age these devices seemed magical to me and quickly it 
					became my favourite thing to explore the different 
					applications and features which were possible on the 
					different devices as there seemed to be limitless 
					possibilities of what they could do.
					<br>
					</p>

				<div class="sectionContent">
                                        <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your 
					interest?
					</h3>
					<p>This interest could not be fostered without the support 
					and interest in computers from my Dad and older brothers 
					who I watched use technology growing up. From complex 
					work-related programs which my dad used or gaming with my 
					brothers I was enthralled with what could be done on a 
					computer that it became the hub which all my other interests
					intersected. From downloading and listening to music, 
					viewing images captured from the family camera, playing games
					like the pinball game ‘3D Space Cadet’, ‘Age of Empires 2’ or
					‘Halo 2’ for hours on end, these activities only being the tip
					of the iceberg. From there my interest not only deepened as my
					age increased but widened, moving from computers to mobile 
					phones. The rate at which innovation and improvement happened 
					was so rapid in the space, with different companies employing 
					different technologies and gimmicks into their devices and 
					expanding what smartphones were through both software and 
					hardware. This field was amazing to witness as no one company 
					had dominance (unlike in current times with the Iphone or 
					Galaxy series phones) so the space was ripe with creativity 
					and change, all this in the attempt of making the best 
					possible device and push the envelope with what a phone could
					achieve, look like and its accessibility to more people.

					<h2>Hybrid Cloud Engineer</h2>

					<h3>In your own words, what is the position, and particularly what
					makes this position appealing to you?</h3>
					<p>The position which has intrigued me is ‘Hybrid Cloud Engineer’
					offered by Logicalis Australia. This position interests me because I
					believe that this field of work and cloud technology is going to be
					vital if not already, as there has been an increase in the rate in
					which data and services are becoming more online based with cloud
					storage servers, cloud computing and other cloud-based technologies.
					This increase I believe is due to the cloud becoming more feasible as
					internetinfrastructure continues to improve allowing it to be more
					accessible to people, furthermore, the rate of improvement of this
					technology and field has enabled it to be financially viable for
					individuals, small businesses or larger companies. The company’s
					focus is on enabling business clients to use the cloud to migrate data
					or their applications.
                                        <br><br>
					The position offered is a team role, the
					hybrid cloud engineer will be working in a team to provide
					improvements to managed services customer environments, with the
					cloud engineer tasked to improve customer environments though
					automation and optimisation. This role I believe would be a perfect
					mid-term goal as my long-term goal would be to work with larger
					companies such as Steam or Google in projects like ‘Steam cloud play’
					or ‘Google Stadia’ these being projects which I’m interested in, as
					the ambition is if there is access to a stable internet connection you
					gain full access to cloud storage, services or even computing power
					all through the cloud. These projects in particular attempt to enable
					games to be played with less powerful, cheaper hardware as the
					computing and processing of the game is completed remotely through
					cloud computing thus enabling consumers to not have to buy expensive
					hardware to play the games at their recommended or intended setting.
					This role as a hybrid cloud engineer will be a fundamental
					steppingstone in understanding the role of a cloud engineer with the
					benefit of being able to work in a team and gain experience
					interfacing with clients.
					</p>

					<h3>Skills I Possess</h3>
					<p>Though only possessing general workplace skills of a
					adequate to strong level, I lack the technical wherewithal to be
					able to qualify for this job. After completing this course there is
					an abundance of further qualifications, knowledge of other
					programming languages that aren't offered in this course and
					comprehension of cloud software/frameworks in addition to the Linux
					system and virtual machines which I’ll have to familiarise, learn
					and gain experience using before I'm able to fully enter this
					profession.
					</p>

					<h3>Skills I Require</h3>
					<p>Possessing general skills such as, effective communication, time
					management, problem solving, conflict management, being client focused
					are valuable in this role. however, in this position IT specific skill
					are the focus, skills such as having practical experience in
					implementing cloud-based solutions in ‘Azure’ Microsoft’s cloud
					computing service, possessing a strong background/prior experience
					with end user compute, cloud, network and security, in addition to
					DevOps reporting and automation experience being preferable as well.
                                        <br><br>
					This background is based on the foundations of many different IT
					fields interweaving, researching more on the role of cloud engineers
					more technical skill which one should have include expertise with the
					Linux operating system is a must as this is the most widely used
					system for cloud development, comprehensive knowledge of cloud
					database management, ability to programming using languages like
					'SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Golang, PHP and .NET 13' to name a few. The
					knowledge required is plentiful however these skills are also used in
					other IT professions in addition to these are garnered through
					experience in the industry or further learning through university as
					this is a more advanced IT position.
					</p>

					<h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Completing this Bachelor of IT course will be the foundation which
					my career will be built on. Aside from entering the workforce and
					gaining experience that way, RMIT offers a Masters in IT but there are
					also courses provided by the Australian Institute of ICT, with a key
					focus on cloud computing and technologies in both courses. Thus,
					completing this masters course and working in an entry level position
					in at a company such as Logicalis Australia which offer junior
					positions in addition to funding for you to learn and improving skills
					which will benefit the career journey which I will be striving for,
					this essentially being the best of both worlds in-terms of gaining
					experience in the industry but also improving and learning more skills
					and gaining the qualifications necessary through further university
					study and through the company I’ll be able to grow and be promoted
					into the position of hybrid cloud engineer if I stay in the company
					or if I wish to move elsewhere I will have both general and technical
					IT skills and knowledge required for the position of Cloud engineer
					with my goal to be involved in the frontier of innovation of this
					technology in art, gaming or business.

					<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
					<p>After completing the 3 different tests it was interesting and
					beneficial finding more about myself in discovering my personality
					type, learning style and which brain dominance I was. Though I
					understand that these are not exactly scientific tests and have a
					degree of generalisation to them, being able to understand who I am
					through these tests will help me cater my learning style as well as
					understand my behaviour and why I may do or react in certain ways or
					not.
                                        <br><br>
					Beginning with the Myers-Briggs test from the ‘16 Personalities’
					website I learned that I was an ‘ENFJ’ personality type called the
					“Protagonist”. ENFJ personality types are characterised by the
					‘extravert’, ‘intuitive’, ‘feeling’ and ‘judging’ personality traits,
					ENFJ’s tend to be forthright, altruistic and charismatic, in addition
					to holding strong ideas and values, being receptive, love helping
					others and strive to achieve their very best when they set goals, or
					when others set goals. (16 Personalities, 2021). Reading the report
					which was given about ENFJ personality types I found myself thinking
					“This accurately describes me” and though may not have as much of an
					inclination to some traits there still is a part of me which
					identifies with them, such as being ‘overly idealistic’ or ‘overly
					empathetic’. The benefit I’ve gained from this test was more
					behavioural, being able to now understand a little better why I may
					act and react certain ways, being able to be attributed to my
					personality type and with this I'm able to keep myself accountable as
					an individual but also when interacting with other people.
                                        <br><br>
					The second and third tests I completed were from ‘Personalities Max’,
					those being the learning styles test and the left/right brain
					dominance test. These two tests helped me understand what my learning
					style and which side of my brain was dominant but also how these two
					intertwined. The result from the learning styles test was that I'm
					quite balanced but lean more to a kinesthetic learning style, which is
					very practical and involved, requiring me to be shown how to do an
					activity or skill and then attempting it myself in order to understand
					how and or why something works. This was closely followed by visual
					making sense as diagrams and illustrations are just as useful and
					allow me to create a mental image of how a structure or object looks
					or functions which is closely tied to being a more ‘Right’ brain
					dominant individual, this tying to the imaginative and creative traits
					associated with being right brain dominant. Having gotten the results
					from these tests it's great to further understand myself, my
					behaviours and how my learning style is interlinked with my brain
					dominance type. This information will not only be helpful personally
					but also in my learning journey during university, but also in a
					social capacity and in my future career.

					<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a
					team?
				  </h3>

					<p>Aside from the personal benefit I’ve gained from these tests, the
					results will help me in social or group learning environments as I’ll
					be better able to understand other people how they function and enable
					better learning practices and improved collaboration as we will be
					able to better tailor each other’s needs, for example; A group member
					might be a visual learner thus, will benefit from illustrations and
					diagrams than paragraphs of information, whilst another might be
					auditory learner and voice memos, meetings and conferences where they
					are able to have information dictated to them or be in a space which
					fosters discussion will benefit them compared to diagrams or written
					information. Another example may be in the form of through knowing a
					person's brain dominance, hypothetically you're able to give them the
					ability to compete tasks or portions of assignments which they would
					be passionate about, more inclined to learn or will provide the best
					results for, so giving a more ‘Right Brain dominant’ person the task
					of creating the user interface or graphics will be closer tied to
					their interests compared to having them be the programmer and code.
					Not saying this person can't do this but the ability for different
					people to collaborate though means which they will be most efficient
					and passionate about will increase the quality of the project, the
					speed in which the project can be done with the overall work
					environment during the project.
                                        <br><br>
					This information was only gathered after doing these tests and will be
					beneficial to me during my studying but also further in my career if
					I’m to work in group environments having this understanding may prove
					advantageous to both myself and the team.
                                        </p>

					<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?
					</h2>
					<p>I will strive to be in a group which is balanced, as I understand
					“Too many astronauts in the rocket and the rocket won’t get anywhere.”
					Meaning a team needs to be diverse and continuing with the metaphor a
					rocket needs an astronaut but also people in the control centre and
					engineers and manufacturers, ultimately saying a variety in skills,
					perspective and understanding will allow our group to be able to
					function its best. As having people who have different personalities,
					learning types and brain dominance, we are able to check for potential
					oversites which another might have missed or be able to understand
					concepts or ideas differently as they are explained from a different
					perspective. But it is also important to be in a group which does not
					veer too far from yourself as this may cause friction as the
					differences can be difficult to solve, however let this not be an
					excuse as it also is important to learn how to solve disagreements and
					how to manage situations which may not be favourable as this is a
					great opportunity to raise intrapersonal and leadership skills.
                                        </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">

				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The proposed project is going to be a smartphone budgeting app, its
					purpose to be the centre where small business owners or individuals
					are able to interact with and manage their finances. With cooperation
					with potential banks enabling the app to have greater integration to
					their finances, through the input from the user of their bank the app
					can give financial summaries at the users given frequency, push
					notifications of upcoming bills and be able to take tax info from
					inputted purchases and to generate tax bills, making tax time easier
					as its possible to keep track and manage different purchases be it
					business or personal.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The app seeks to enable easier budgeting, make the process more
					intuitive, simple yet comprehensive enough for business, an
					accountant before a professional accountant if you will. With the
					Consumer Policy Research Centre (2020), highlighting that Covid-19
					has increased consumer vulnerability, this being linked to job loss
					and a decrease in income for people and businesses alike, with those
					who are financially literate able to spend from saving but those
					who didn't have savings being worse off. The app hopes to help
					people become more financially literate and understand the power of
					budgeting and how it's able to alleviate the stress caused by
					unpredictable financial events.
                                        </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>With the purpose of this app being to help increase the
					capabilities of small businesses and individuals in a financial
					capacity, thus the features which the app can potentially do should
					enable this. The primary role of this app is to be a budgeting app and
					so to reflect this the app will allow users to create different
					budgets from editable templates for individual, household or small
					business, with these budgets being able to potentially be linked to
					the users chosen bank account. This gives them a real time update on
					their spending through setting a set spend amount, with alerts given
					to highlight the users’ expenditures and where they are regarding
					breaching their given budget. Furthermore, within each budget it is
					possible to get a more detailed breakdown and the expenditures in
					addition to being able to create tax invoices for the expenditures
					(like those given when making an online purchase) this enabling them
					to better keep track and have receipts of their purchases over time
					for when taxes must be done. Another feature for families includes the
					ability to promote healthy financial practices to children via
					parental oversight through pocket money/allowances management, through
					the household budget option you would be able to link family member
					accounts under a main one and allowing this to be possible. It is also
					important to understand the link with the bank does not allow for 15
					the transfer or movement of funds through the app nor will it display
					the sensitive information of users as this is most likely breaching
					many laws alongside the app not taking the same degree of precautions
					such as those taken by banks regarding that subject. but the app
					allows for the data (that is not personal like customer registration
					numbers) which are presented on banking apps/ internet banking to also
					be displayed and be better interpreted by the user on the app compared
					to what may be offered by banks.
					<br><br>
					Obstacles and limitations of this project begin in the research stage
					as there will need to be understanding of what on the market is like
					this for apps which provide the same or similar services, being able
					to compare and contrast their implementation and try avoiding making
					the same mistakes be it logistically or user interface and design.
					Another obstacle is with the feasibility of this project regarding the
					implementation or cooperation with banks and privacy and data security
					management as this is an area which will need to be carefully
					administered as there will be personal banking information which may
					be gathered and a breach of this will be detrimental with the app
					creators and banks being held liable and the user being left
					vulnerable as their information is not secured, thus making this a
					vital part of the project to invest time and resources into, to ensure
					that the app is not a risk to the banks nor users involved.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The main software to be used in the development of this app are
					‘MIT app inventor' for the back end development and ‘Proto.io’ or
					‘Mockup.io’ for the front end development. MIT App inventor is an
					open-source program usable by anyone but proto.io or mockup.io are not
					, though they do provide free trials as well as educational discounted
					pricing for the use of their full suite of their products for students
					. In terms of hardware, a computer, phone and stable internet
					connection will be the most fundamental things: computer for creation,
					phone for testing and internet connection to be able to move files
					easier from phone to computer and vice versa. Additional extra
					software includes being able to access cloud storage services be those
					provided by Microsoft, amazon or google to be able to store and
					transfer user data.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>To be able to develop this tool it is important to understand
					programming languages like python or java/C++ to understand the
					processes which will help the app work. However, using programs
					such as MIT App Inventor we are able to create a rudimentary version
					of the app as the program has the necessary tools to be the backbone
					and provide the structure for the app without great knowledge of
					programming being required. Furthermore, the use of software like
					‘Proto.io/ Mockup.io’ will aid in the creation of the user interface
					and provide graphical artefacts to understand how the app will look
					and function with skills in art and design being beneficial for this
					section of the project. It is feasible to create a basic version of
					this app with a computer, phone and the software mentioned,
					implementing all the features, however, will require large amounts of
					work and research as this is an ambitious project if implemented fully
					. Another skill would also include understanding the cloud and how
					cloud storage would be able to be implemented in storing data.
                                        </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>On the success of this app the impact will be through the increased
					financial literacy of users and to be a robust financial management
					tool for both small businesses and individuals. The app will enable
					its users to understand where their money goes and implement better
					financial practices, the added benefit of being able to generate tax
					bills and invoices will enable tax time to be much less of a daunting
					task as the app can be seen as an assistant accountant of sorts
					empowering people to take control of their finances easier and in a
					much more intuitive way. Thus, helping solve financial hardship
					through the promotion of healthy financial practices be for
					individuals, households or small businesses alike.
